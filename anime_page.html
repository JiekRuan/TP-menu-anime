                <p>During the late 19th century, Great Britain has become the greatest empire the world has ever known. Hidden within its success, 
                    the nation's rigid economic hierarchy dictates the value of one's life solely on status and wealth. 
                    To no surprise, the system favors the aristocracy at the top and renders it impossible for the working class to ascend the ranks.</p>

                <p>On the surface, the thought of Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura getting along would be the last thing in people's minds. 
                    After all, Hori has a perfect combination of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears meek and distant to his fellow classmates. 
                    However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. Even though she is popular at school, 
                    Hori has little time to socialize with her friends due to housework. 
                    On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent.</p>

                <p>Thirty-seven-year-old Satoru Mikami is a typical corporate worker, who is perfectly content with his monotonous lifestyle in Tokyo, other than failing to nail down a girlfriend even once throughout his life. 
                    In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. 
                    However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.</p>

                <time datetime="2021-04-10T20:00:00"> Apr 11, 2021 to ?</time>
                <p>Takemichi Hanagaki's life is at an all-time low. Just when he thought it couldn't get worse, he finds out that Hinata Tachibana, his ex-girlfriend, 
                    was murdered by the Tokyo Manji Gang: a group of vicious criminals that has been disturbing society's peace for quite some time.
                Wondering where it all went wrong, Takemichi suddenly finds himself travelling through time, ending up 12 years in the past—when he was still in a relationship with Hinata. 
                Realizing he has a chance to save her, Takemichi resolves to infiltrate the Tokyo Manji Gang and climb the ranks in order to rewrite the future and save Hinata from her tragic fate.</p>

                <time datetime="2021-04-10T20:00:00">Oct 6, 2020 to Dec 22, 2020</time>
                <p>The Demon Lord Tasogare's castle is a dark and frightening place, filled to the brim with various monsters. 
                    Any soul unfortunate enough to be imprisoned here is sure to be terrified by the horrors within. However, the human princess Aurora Suya Rhys "Syalis" Kaymin is a different case. 
                    Rather indifferent to her situation, Syalis worries about one thing and one thing only—sleep. 
                    Ever since the demon lord kidnapped her from her kingdom, she has not had a single good night's rest.</p>
